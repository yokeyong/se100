In a world where screens light up the night,  
Web development’s the key to ignite.  
From HTML’s structure, so sturdy and clear,  
To CSS magic, making visions appear.  

JavaScript dances, bringing life to the page,  
With frameworks and libraries, you’ll engage.  
The internet’s vast, a canvas so wide,  
Crafting your future, let passion be your guide.  

Build, design, create with each line you code,  
Unlocking the potential in every road.  
In this digital age, the skills you refine,  
Open doors to a future where your dreams shine.
